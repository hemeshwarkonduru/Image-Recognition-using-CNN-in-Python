# Image-Recognition-using-CNN-in-Python
As my device's RAM is limited, I have trained the  Recognition model between two categories only.



The main idea is to just concentrate on the features of the image using convolution layer and pooling.
For more precision more convolutional layers can be added.


the data is seperated into training and test set contains 4000 and 1000 images respectively 
and the accuracy of the model ranges from 82-85% .


The model is cnn.py.
To test the model with a different image output.py is used.

dataset is not uploaded here because of the size of the dataset as they are images.
